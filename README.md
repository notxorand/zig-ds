# zig data structures

This is a compilation of common data structures and trees in Zig. Most of these exist in the Rust ecosystem already (not standardised), so I'm mostly porting them over.

It's a work in progress, with plans for:

- [x] bitmap
- [x] bloom filter
- [ ] cuckoo filter
- [ ] merkle tree
- [ ] merkle mountain range (mmr)
- [ ] sparse merkle tree (smt)
- [ ] lamport clock
- [ ] vector clock

Note: I just started writing Zig, so don't expect things to necessarily work as expected.
